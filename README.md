# angular-TourOfHeroes
following along the tutorial from angular 2 site

Basically following along the tutorials in angular 2 site (https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/tutorial/)
while learning it.

*wondering: why google team even bothered with re-inventing the wheel of Ruby on Rails with this Angular.JS; yeah sure the tagline is component first
but isn't that already can be done with partial in RoR ??
Full javascript ?? well even the language is kept being updated so it become easier and eventually will become like Ruby (well not really,
you can't compete with the cleanliness of ruby language unless you are building the new language from ground up with thinking of simplicity
and mighty).

I bet the end game for Javascript / Typescript is to become mighty and clean like RoR, yet why ?? (hopefully they'll aims to create
android and chrome apps from this Javascript / Typescript).
